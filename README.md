# Waveman

2018 Update - this is the first project I finished for the app store. Written (poorly) in Objective-C. Has a folder of original pixel art I created from drawings I scanned into Photoshop. Heavily relies on code from this [article](https://digitalbreed.com/2014/02/10/how-to-build-a-game-like-flappy-bird-with-xcode-and-sprite-kit), and the SpriteKit tutorials on Ray Wenderlich. Written in late 2015 without Source Control so no previous commit history.
